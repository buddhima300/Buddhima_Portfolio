      "I contributed to the frontend development of an enterprise internal system used by over 100 employees, delivering assigned features across multiple modules. As part of this work, I refactored existing React components to align with standardized project structures, improving code consistency across more than six system modules. I implemented UI enhancements and resolved bugs within the Sales Incentive workflow, which reduced reported UI defects by 30% during UAT cycles. Additionally, I integrated frontend screens with over 15 backend APIs, ensuring data accuracy and proper handling of edge cases during testing. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams in a hybrid work environment and consistently met 100% of sprint delivery deadlines. I also assisted in documenting frontend patterns and folder conventions, helping onboard two peer developers more efficiently, participated in code reviews to improve component reusability and readability, and supported production releases by verifying UI behavior across browsers, reducing post-release issues by 20%.",
